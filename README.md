This repository is a practice project for getting and cleaning data. 

# Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
Also attached in the file called "smartphone.zip"

# Files: 
- CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called 
- run_analysis.R: one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
                  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
                  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
                  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- tidy_data.txt: the dity data generated from the last step in the R script.
